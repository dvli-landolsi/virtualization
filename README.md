## Virtualized List Component

This template includes a Virtualized List Component, designed to efficiently render large lists of items using virtualization techniques. The Virtualized List Component renders only the items that are currently visible on the screen, rather than rendering the entire list at once. This approach significantly improves the performance and memory usage of applications dealing with large datasets.

### How it Works

The Virtualized List Component utilizes dynamic item rendering and fixed table header and footer to optimize performance:

1. **Dynamic Item Rendering**: Instead of rendering all items in the list, the component dynamically calculates which items are currently visible based on the scroll position. It then renders only those items, reducing DOM manipulation and improving rendering performance.

2. **Fixed Table Header and Footer**: The component includes a fixed table header and footer, ensuring they remain visible while scrolling through the list. This provides a consistent user experience and makes it easier to navigate through the data.

### Usage

To use the Virtualized List Component in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `VirtualizedList` component from the appropriate file.

   ```javascript
   import VirtualizedList from "./VirtualizedList";
   ```
